# Game-of-Life-Neighbor-Count

This is a part of John Conway's Game of Life Cellular Automata.
So, this program, without using any external libraries counts
the number of neighbors of specific data in memory and taking care of the
negative and out-of-bound indices while doing so.
Thus, giving us the required result.

It is written in C++ and you might be able to run it as it doesn't
use any external libraries.
I worked on this program using Visual Studio 2019.

Happy Coding. :)
